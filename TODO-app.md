# TODO for Implementing Netflix UI Style in client/app.js

- [x] Fetch movie categories from /api/categories endpoint
- [x] Identify and select a hero movie (preferably one marked as isHero: true, or fallback to first movie)
- [x] Create and inject hero section HTML into #main-content
- [x] For each movie category, create a scrollable row with movie cards
- [x] Add click event listeners to movie cards to navigate to watch.html with movie ID
- [x] Handle loading states and error cases
- [x] Add Netflix-style CSS to client/app.css (dark theme, responsive layout, hover effects)
- [x] Test the UI rendering and functionality
